- micropython_pico.uf2
- micropython_pico2.uf2  
- micropython_pico2w.uf2 

These uf2 files already included main.py ,so just put into PicoCalc , you will get a python running terminal immediately

For developers, just visit [PicoCalc-micropython-driver](https://github.com/zenodante/PicoCalc-micropython-driver)  

Follow the readme to
